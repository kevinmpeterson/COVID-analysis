# COVID-analysis
Simple scripts for examining COVID data from Johns Hopkins. These scripts pull data from the John's Hopkins COVID-19 [dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/) and generate plots for the US and California. I used some insight from Tomas Pueyo's Medium [post](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca). In particular, this uses a 6.9x multiplier to estimate true cases based on confirmed reports.

Here is the current US data:
